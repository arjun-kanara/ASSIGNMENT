1) WHAT IS JQUERY ?


 
  jQuery is a small, light-weight and fast JavaScript library.
  It is cross-platform and supports different types of browsers. 
  It is also referred as ?write less do more? because it takes a lot of common tasks that requires many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and binds them into methods that can be called with a single line of code whenever needed.
  It is also very useful to simplify a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
